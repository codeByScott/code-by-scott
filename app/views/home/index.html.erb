    <p>
      I'm a Ruby on Rails developer that enjoys working with other technologies
      as well. I have lived around the globe. You can currently find me in
      <strong>Sasebo, Japan</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very interested in working with a great team of other like minded
      individuals. I like surrounding myself with people that are smarter than
      I am. Are you interested in working with someone that strives
      to grow everyday? If so, you should start the conversation by
      <a href="#">sending me
      a message</a>.

      You can find me on the web. I micro blog on <a href="">Twitter</a>,
      post horrendous videos on <a href="">YouTube</a>,
      and share my work on <a href="">GitHub</a>.
