    <h2 class="section-title about">Hi, my name is Scott.</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Ruby on Rails developer that enjoys working with other technologies
      as well. I have lived around the globe. You can currently find me in
      <strong>Sasebo, Japan</strong> but I'm relocating to the United States
      November 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very interested in working with a great team of other like minded
      individuals. I like surrounding myself with people that are smarter than
      I am. Are you interested in working with someone that strives
      to grow everyday? If so, you should start the conversation by
      <%= link_to "sending me a message", new_contact_path %></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find me on the web. I micro blog on <a href="https://twitter.com/codebyscott">Twitter</a>,
      post horrendous videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQLifsB_u_uRDzRHOaMqmyg">YouTube</a>,
      and share my work on <a href="https://github.com/codeByScott">GitHub</a>.
